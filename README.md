This app is for translating text from language to another. 
Built using mlkit dependencies, I have used custom ArrayAdapters
for the layout of the spinner, TranslatorOptions to build a translator model for 
our requirements like config file(JK), Translator to actually build the model with TranslatorOptions
along with DownloadConditions to download the model if needs or else it would run with 
google play services. TranslateLanguage class is used to get Language codes to be sent
into TranslatorOptions. TextToSpeech is used to get the speech of the translated though
not all languages are available on it still used it which ever is available and for others the speak 
button is disabled.
